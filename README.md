<li>The interface should offer clear instructions and intuitive functionalities for both standard URL shortening and custom short identifier creation (optional).</li>
<li>The interface should display relevant information to users, such as:
<ul>
<li>The original long URL</li>
<li>The generated short identifier (if successful)</li>
<li>Options to copy or share the short identifier (if successful)</li>
<li>Error messages with clear explanations in case of failures (e.g., invalid URL format, duplicate custom identifier)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The interface should enforce input validation rules to prevent users from submitting invalid or malformed URLs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="url-validation">URL Validation</h5>
<ul>
<li>The service shall implement robust URL validation mechanisms to ensure submitted URLs adhere to the correct format (e.g., following HTTP or HTTPS protocols).</li>
<li>Validation checks should include verifying:
<ul>
<li>Proper URL structure (protocol, domain name, path)</li>
<li>Valid domain names (resolvable DNS records)</li>
<li>Reachable endpoints (using techniques like HTTP HEAD requests)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The service should handle potential issues gracefully, such as returning error messages for invalid URLs or offering options to retry with corrected URLs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="short-identifier-generation">Short Identifier Generation</h5>
<ul>
<li>Upon successful URL validation, the service shall generate a unique, cryptographically secure short identifier for the submitted long URL.</li>
<li>The short identifier length shall be configurable (default: 7 characters) to balance user convenience with the need for a large namespace to handle a vast number of shortened URLs.</li>
<li>The character set for short identifiers shall be alphanumeric and case-insensitive (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) to ensure readability and compatibility across various digital platforms.</li>
<li>The service shall employ a collision-resistant hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to generate short identifiers, minimizing the probability of conflicts between randomly generated codes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="custom-short-identifiers-optional">Custom Short Identifiers (Optional)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5 id="user-permissions">User Permissions</h5>
<ul>
<li>The service shall implement a user permission system to restrict custom short identifier creation to authorized users or specific user groups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="character-set-validation">Character Set Validation</h5>
<ul>
<li>The service shall enforce strict character set validation for custom short identifiers, allowing only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-) to prevent invalid or malicious codes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="minimum-length">Minimum Length</h5>
<ul>
<li>The service shall mandate a minimum length (e.g., 8 characters) for custom short identifiers to minimize conflicts with randomly generated codes and improve manageability.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="url-redirection">URL Redirection</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5 id="redirection-behavior">3.1 Redirection Behavior</h5>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on a short identifier shall trigger an HTTP redirection response with an appropriate status code. The default behavior should be a 301 Moved Permanently for permanent redirects, indicating the long URL has a new location. Alternatively, a 302 Found status code can be used for temporary redirects.</li>

<li>The service should be able to handle roughly 8,000 redirection requests per second. This translates to smooth user experience with minimal delays when clicking on shortened URLs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="horizontal-scaling">Horizontal Scaling</h5>
<ul>
<li>The system design should prioritize horizontal scaling capabilities. This means the ability to add more web servers and database nodes to the infrastructure as traffic demands increase.

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h6 id="rapid-redirection">Rapid Redirection</h6>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on a shortened URL should result in a swift redirection to the original long URL. Users should experience minimal waiting time before being directed to the desired content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="caching-strategy">Caching Strategy</h5>
<ul>
<li>Implementing a caching layer (e.g., Memcached) is essential for optimizing performance. Frequently accessed short URL mappings can be stored in the cache, reducing the load on the database and enabling faster redirection responses. The cache should be configured with appropriate eviction policies to ensure data freshness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="load-balancing">Load Balancing</h5>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="redundancy">Redundancy</h5>
<ul>
<li>Implementing redundancy in critical components like web servers and database nodes is crucial for achieving high availability. This means having multiple instances of these components running, so the service remains operational even if one node fails.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5 id="disaster-recovery-plan">Disaster Recovery Plan</h5>
<ul>
<li>A comprehensive disaster recovery plan should be in place to ensure quick recovery from unforeseen events like hardware failures or natural disasters. This plan should outline procedures for restoring data and resuming service operations with minimal disruption.</li>

<li>If no existing short identifier is found:
<ul>
<li>The web server generates a unique, cryptographically secure short identifier using a collision-resistant hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256).</li>
<li>The short identifier length can be configurable (default: 7 characters) for a balance between user convenience and a large namespace.</li>
<li>The character set for short identifiers will be alphanumeric and case-insensitive (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) to ensure readability across platforms.</li>
